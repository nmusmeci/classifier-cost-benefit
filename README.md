# Classifier profit calculator
Python library to calculate the expected net profit that will result from the application of a classifier in a commercial setting. The expected net profit is calculated for each value of the classifier's threshold (hence a net profit curve).

It can also be used to choose an optimal cut-off for the classifier that is problem-specific and has a clear business objective, as opposed to e.g. maximising F1 score.
